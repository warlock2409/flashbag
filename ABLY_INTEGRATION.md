# Ably Integration Guide

This guide explains how to use the Ably implementation for subscribing to events by key in your Angular application.

## Installation

The Ably library has already been installed in your project:

```bash
npm install ably
```

## Services

### AblyService

The [AblyService](file:///c:/Users/rajar/Desktop/Mvp/cursor/flashbag/src/app/services/ably.service.ts#L7-L119) provides a wrapper around the Ably JavaScript library with the following key methods:

1. **initialize(apiKey: string)** - Initialize the Ably client with your API key
2. **subscribe(channelName: string, callback: Function, eventName?: string)** - Subscribe to a channel and optionally a specific event name
3. **unsubscribe(channelName: string, eventName?: string, callback?: Function)** - Unsubscribe from a channel or specific event
4. **publish(channelName: string, eventName: string, data: any)** - Publish a message to a channel with a specific event name
5. **close()** - Close the Ably connection

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, OnDestroy } from '@angular/core';
import { AblyService } from '../services/ably.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '...'
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  constructor(private ablyService: AblyService) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    // Initialize with your Ably API key
    this.ablyService.initialize('YOUR_ABLY_API_KEY');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    // Clean up connections
    this.ablyService.close();
  }
}
```

### Subscribing to Events by Key

```typescript
// Subscribe to a specific event key on a channel
async subscribeToKey() {
  await this.ablyService.subscribe(
    'my-channel', 
    (message) => {
      console.log('Received message:', message);
      // Handle the message
    },
    'my-event-key'  // The event key to subscribe to
  );
}
```

### Publishing Messages

```typescript
// Publish a message to a specific event key
async publishMessage() {
  await this.ablyService.publish(
    'my-channel',
    'my-event-key',
    { text: 'Hello world!', timestamp: new Date() }
  );
}
```

## Example Components

### KeyBasedSubscriptionComponent

This component demonstrates key-based subscriptions with a complete UI for:
- Initializing Ably with an API key
- Subscribing to specific event keys
- Publishing messages to event keys
- Managing subscriptions

To use this component, import it into your module or standalone component:

```typescript
import { KeyBasedSubscriptionComponent } from './components/shared/key-based-subscription/key-based-subscription.component';

// In your component imports array
imports: [
  // ... other imports
  KeyBasedSubscriptionComponent
]
```

Then use it in your template:

```html
<app-key-based-subscription></app-key-based-subscription>
```

## Best Practices

1. **API Key Security**: Never hardcode your Ably API key in client-side code. In production, use a token-based authentication system or server-side token requestor.

2. **Connection Management**: Always call `close()` when your component is destroyed to prevent memory leaks.

3. **Error Handling**: Always wrap Ably operations in try-catch blocks to handle network errors gracefully.

4. **Channel Naming**: Use descriptive channel names that reflect the data being transmitted.

5. **Event Keys**: Use consistent event keys throughout your application to make it easier to manage subscriptions.

## Integration with Authentication

You can integrate Ably with your existing authentication system by initializing the service after successful login:

```typescript
// In your auth service or component
constructor(
  private ablyService: AblyService,
  private authService: AuthService
) {}

async onLogin() {
  // After successful authentication
  const user = this.authService.getCurrentUser();
  
  // Initialize Ably with user-specific token or API key
  this.ablyService.initialize(`user-${user.id}-key`);
  
  // Subscribe to user-specific channels
  await this.ablyService.subscribe(
    `user-${user.id}-notifications`,
    this.handleNotification.bind(this),
    'notification'
  );
}
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**: Verify your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions.

2. **Subscription Problems**: Ensure the channel name and event key match exactly what's being published.

3. **Message Format**: Ably messages can contain any JSON-serializable data. Make sure your data structure is consistent.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: The Ably library works in all modern browsers. Check the Ably documentation for specific compatibility information.
